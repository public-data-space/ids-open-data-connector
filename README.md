# IDS Open Data Connector

This is the Repository collecting setup files to conveniently boot an instance of the IDS Open Data Connector via docker-compose.
The IDS Open Data Connector is a **work in progress**. Please contribute by reporting issues.

## Requirements
* git
* docker
* docker-compose 3.5 or higher
* DAPS Certificates

## Starting the Connector

To use the broker valid DAPS certificates are necessary. The certificate needs to be placed in a keystore file. Further a truststore containing, the SSL certficate of the DAPS needs to be available.
Place those files into a folder named `certs` located in the same folder, als the docker-compose.yml. Alternatively adjust the volume path in the docker-compose to point your keystore/truststore folder.

### Using prebuild images (recommended)

To start the connector manually run:

```sh startup.sh [-t]``` 

The -t parameter specifies the wait time between initialisation of important containers. It defaults to 10 seconds, but may be lowered depending on the machine the connector is run on.

The connector can also be started using docker-compose up -d. However due to initialization times of containers, errors may occur. We therefore recommend using the startup script.

### Building the connector from source

#### Setup
* git clone

(On windows machines line endings may be problematic when used with docker. The file backend\postgres\docker-entrypoint-initdb.d\00_create_db.sh needs to use UNIX line endings.)
(The database is setup using the aforementioned script. Make sure to allow mounting of files into your docker containers. )

* Run ```sh setup.sh```

#### Building

Follow the instructions in the readme files of the individual components project folders.

#### Starting the connector

The setup.sh will automatically boot the connector after setup.
To start the connector manually run:

```sh startup.sh -f docker-compose_build.yml [-t]``` 

The -t parameter specifies the wait time between initialisation of important containers. It defaults to 10 seconds, but may be lowered depending on the machine the connector is run on.

The connector can also be started using docker-compose up -d. However due to initialization times of containers, errors may occur. We therefore recommend using the startup script.


## Usage
* Frontend is available at localhost/browse
* Username: *admin* Password: *admin*
* Enter connector configuration via *Konfiguration* first

### Registering a Data Asset
* Register a DataSource via *Hinzuf√ºgen*
* Example CKAN instance is available at http://ids-backend.fokus.fraunhofer.de/
* CKAN API URL of the example instance is http://ids-backend.fokus.fraunhofer.de/api/3/action
* Click on the registered DataSource and enter the prompted information
* Example CKAN resource ID: b7325acb-02a0-4d19-9a13-f5f917036a1e

### Registering to a broker
* Register the connector at a broker via *Brokers*

### Managing Apps
* Apps can be started and stopped via *Apps*
* The Apps view lists all currently available docker images on the system
* The docker service trims the urls of the prebuild images but will list locally built images as is
